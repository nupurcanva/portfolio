                        <p>When I joined Canva's Ecosystem team as <strong>Lead Product Designer</strong>, we were making a fundamental mistake: treating all developers as a monolithic group. Our team would refer to "developers" as if they all had the same needs, goals, and pain points. The reality was far more complex.</p>
                        
                        <p>Canva's developer ecosystem had grown to include everyone from independent hobbyists building weekend projects to enterprise teams creating mission-critical integrations. Yet our product decisions were largely based on internal developer opinions rather than real user research.</p>

                        <h2>üé® Creating the Archetypes: My Design Process</h2>
                        
                        <p>To create the developer archetypes, I began by synthesizing extensive research from over <strong>40 developer interviews and usability sessions</strong>. Rather than simply categorizing developers by job titles, I identified behavioral patterns that transcended roles. Through careful analysis, I discovered three critical dimensions that defined developer behavior: level of support needed, flexibility with design standards, and expected speed to release.</p>
                        
                        <p>I led cross-functional workshops with product managers, engineers, and designers to validate these patterns. Using FigJam, I facilitated ideation sessions where we mapped developer behaviors to their underlying needs and motivations. This collaborative approach ensured the archetypes would be actionable across all teams.</p>
                        
                        <div class="section-image">

                        </div>
                        
                        <p>From this synthesis, I defined five distinct archetypes: Optimizers, Go-Getters, Platform Amplifiers, System Integrators, and Enterprise Customizers. For each archetype, I documented their values, pain points, gains, and linked them to real apps in our ecosystem as concrete examples.</p>
                        
                        <div class="highlight-box">

                        <p>I validated the framework by immediately applying it to active projects, including the Developer Experience Vision and RICE platform planning. By analyzing our metrics through the archetype lens, I revealed why certain features had low enterprise adoption but high usage among independent developers.</p>

                        <p><strong>Their pains:</strong> Difficult to find direct contact information for support, limited access to business-related information, multiple rounds of review with inconsistent feedback, and lack of access to early adopters for testing.</p>

                        <p>As we refined our understanding of developer archetypes, we began exploring a potential sixth archetype: <strong>AI Agents</strong>. These would be AI systems designed to autonomously develop, deploy, and manage apps within Canva.</p>
                        
                        <div class="highlight-box">

                        <h3>The Challenge of Balance</h3>
                        <p>One of our ongoing challenges was ensuring we didn't over-index on any single archetype. While it might be tempting to focus on the "biggest fish," we recognized that a healthy ecosystem needs diversity. Optimizers might build the innovative features that attract users, while System Integrators create the robust integrations that retain enterprise customers.</p>
