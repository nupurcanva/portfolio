                    <!-- Introduction -->
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h2>üíå Introduction</h2>
                        <p>I worked as a designer on the Bitbucket team for 2 years. During the last few months, we set on a mission to determine the strategy and long-term vision for Bitbucket Pipelines, which is a CI/CD management tool. I did this by conducting a 2-day workshop with various stakeholders on defining the customer problems and defining what an end vision would look like. We prioritized them and explored various themes as described below. Finally, we set some guiding design principles for the experience.</p>
                        
                        <h3>üÜï About this Project</h3>
                        <p>This work was intended to be used to spark conversation on our product strategy, roadmap and future envisioning pieces. The goal of this effort was to align and inspire our teams with an actionable experience vision for Bitbucket that connects the dots between the current strategy and work streams.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The problem</strong></p>
                        <p>There was no visualization that connected the dots across the multi-year strategy and the vision for Bitbucket. This made it incredibly difficult for teams, stakeholders, and customers to grok what Bitbucket Pipelines is and to get excited about where we're going in the future.</p>
                        
                        <p>There was an opportunity to do three things:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Communicate our strategy in a clear, fun, easily accessible, and memorable way.</li>
                            <li>Inspire and rally the team and wider Atlassian audiences.</li>
                            <li>Excite and inspire our customers and other stakeholders, bringing them on our journey.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Setting the Context -->

                        <h2>üßëüèº‚Äçüíª Setting the context: What are Bitbucket Pipelines (CI/CD)?</h2>
                        <p>Imagine a developer writing some code. They push it to the cloud to integrate it with the rest of the code. Every time they push it, it is being tested, verified & integrated into the codebase and delivered to their customers. This is known as CI/CD (Continuous integration and continuous deployment) and Bitbucket helps them manage code and the CI/CD flow.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>I was responsible for collecting and presenting secondary research before the workshop, work with a small team to define the journeys, design and facilitate the workshop, work with the product manager and the entire team to refine the ideas and road-show the vision to multiple stakeholders to get buy-ins and have roadmap discussions.</p>
                        
                        <h3>ü§º The team</h3>
                        <p>We had me as the designer, a content designer, a team of 10 engineers, an engineering manager, a product manager, a marketing manager and a support engineer for the workshop. Later on, I worked on the experience vision with the support of other designers.</p>

                        <p><strong>Day 1: Product vision and Research</strong></p>
                        <p>On day 1, I presented the past research and future goals of the team. I looked at various competitive products and their differentiating features. As a team, we came up with two problem statements for the two feature teams. Then we split into 2 groups to tackle 2 legs of the end-to-end journey. Group A was the CI journey and Group B was the CD journey.</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reviewing secondary research and competitive research in CI/CD</li>
                            <li>Forming problem statements</li>
                            <li>Mapping current user experience journey across CI and CD, reviewing opportunities and pain points for the key persona</li>

                        <p>Throughout day 2, we went through the following key ideation activities:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Coming up with a wide range of ideas and then theming them</li>
                            <li>Prioritizing the ideas into urgency and impact graph</li>
                            <li>Storyboarding customer journey based on the voted ideas</li>

                                <p>Quarterly reports have shown that the adoption of Bitbucket Pipelines is reducing in larger teams and we believe the main cause of the churn is scalability limits. With Carebear, many mid-market and enterprise teams will be moving to Bitbucket, and we need to ensure Bitbucket Pipelines is ready for them.</p>

                        <p><strong>What are Design Principles and why use them?</strong></p>
                        <p>Design principles are a set of considerations that form the basis of any good product. They are empirical, experience-backed, strongly-held opinions about the experience we want to create. An entire team agrees to follow them when designing products and services. They are <em>directive</em> rather than <em>prescriptive</em>; in other words, they speak to the <em>what</em> and <em>why</em> of our designs, not the <em>how</em>.</p>
                        
                        <p>Design principles help teams with decision-making. When it comes to making tradeoffs or hard choices, first principles guide us to still be true to our sense of purpose and find clarity amidst the noise.</p>
                        
                        <h3>üíô What about Bitbucket Principles?</h3>
                        <p>How might we come out with principles that champion the users we are designing for, yet still match the purpose and feel familiar with Atlassian principles/values? Given the situation outlined in the section above, we've outlined the key themes we believe are critical to the future of CI/CD and will help us create more meaningful experiences in the sections below.</p>

                        <p>We did this activity at the end of ideation. I personally love this activity. It's a real insight into what our users see as success and what they see as a failure in our delivery of a solution. It gives our users the opportunity to tell us what we need to consider when designing a solution to their problems. It also allows us back in the office to set success criteria and acceptance targets to ensure that the solution we design meets the expectations of our users.</p>

                        <p>The project was an interesting cross-collaboration between design, PM and developers from the Bitbucket team, and had a great impact on the team planning and execution. I had a great time organizing the in-person workshop and getting all of the team on the same page and context.</p>
                        
                        <p>As a next phase, it was worthwhile to create an end-to-end journey and to run tests with the proposed designs for the long-term vision. I heard positive feedback for many of them, and they were road mapped into the product roadmap and published online.</p>
