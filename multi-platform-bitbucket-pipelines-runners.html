                        <h2>üèÉüèª The Problem</h2>
                        <p>Atlassian's Bitbucket Pipelines offers an easy-to-get-started cloud-based CI/CD solution, but over the years many teams have run into issues, like users cannot access resources in their private network that are protected by firewalls, using other platforms like macOS, scalability issues, rate-limiting, compliance and technical limitations of a cloud-based solution.</p>
                        
                        <p>This hinders them from using Bitbucket Pipelines as their CI/CD solution. Users want access to internal resources to run integration tests against private resources(eg: database, application), deploy to internal infrastructure, use MacOS or windows platform and access hosted secrets manager.</p>
                        
                        <div class="section-image">

                        <p>To do this, users have to open a port in their firewall to do a deployment from Bitbucket Pipeline into their private network, which has security implications, and it is a costly affair to move all of their code and CI/CD to a competing tool. It would be solved if Bitbucket allowed them to run pipeline steps in their own infrastructure.</p>

                        <p>Users are using another CI/CD tool. This causes more friction because they have to set up and pay for another tool, and they miss out on the integrated code and CI/CD experience.

                        <p>The project ran for a whole year, from August 2020 to July 2021. I looked at the UX research, gathered technical requirements and designed the UI for the last year. During this time we researched and tested it many times, and being agile was crucial to delivering the right experiences for both product and design. I worked with the Product manager to get the right data and the engineering lead to set the right values and plan for the updates.</p>

                        <h2>üéΩ What are Bitbucket Pipelines (CI/CD) and Runners?</h2>
                        <p>Imagine a developer writing some code. They push it to the cloud to integrate it with the rest of the code. Every time they push it, it is being tested, verified & integrated into the codebase and delivered to their customers. This is known as CI/CD (Continuous integration and continuous deployment)</p>

                        <p><strong>Runners</strong> are the way we solved the above problem, so imagine providing a way to install a small software on your computer to run all the CI/CD without sharing it with the cloud. Self-hosted runners offer more control of hardware, control of the Operating system and more security and network options than Bitbucket-hosted runners provide for running the CI/CD.</p>

                        <p>Our hypothesis is that users want to run pipelines in their private networks and the way they can do that is by self-hosted runners. We need to begin to validate this belief, and this research represents a step toward understanding our customer's requirements and evaluating the solution. We, therefore, seek to:</p>

                            <li>Understand user's requirements, scale and challenges with self-hosted runners</li>
                            <li>Identify the best solution offering by evaluating the design thinking</li>

                        <p>I did 6 1-hour interviews with large and medium-sized customers. The roles of the interviewees were - Ops engineers, embedded systems developers and lead software developers. I compiled the findings and shared them as a Confluence page with the team before we kicked off the design process.</p>

                        <p>There are three types of jobs we had to do to deliver a full experience for the Runners. They were further broken down to requirements and were parallelized as much as possible. The jobs and their requirements:</p>

                        <p>I experimented with a few different styles for the Runner Installation and management. We wanted to give the easiest way to get started and scale up as the requirements grow. To get started on the first experience, I created a user journey and a few explorations and we conducted a user study to get input on the experience and the requirements.</p>

                        <h3>Outside inside</h3>
                        <p>Obtain new viewpoints. Speak to outside users. To get ideas and set your product against others, look at products that are both closely and distantly competitive to yours.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Think long-term scalability</h3>
                        <p>A prescription for short-term success but failure in the long run is to not have a vision for what the product will look like in a few years. It may cause the product to be directed in the wrong direction, and a U-turn may be very costly.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Inclusive design</h3>
                        <p>When creating products, accessibility is a crucial factor. It goes without saying that we should be inclusive of users with disabilities. As a designer, it's important to ensure the basics like maintaining the minimum <strong>colour contrasts</strong> and focus states while creating mockups.</p>
