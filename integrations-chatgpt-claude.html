                        <h2>üöÄ Project Overview</h2>
                        <p>As <strong>Senior Product Designer</strong> leading Canva's AI Assistant integrations company goal, I drove the design strategy for one of the most critical initiatives in Canva's history - transforming our platform from a standalone design tool into essential infrastructure for AI-powered creative workflows. This strategic design exploration emerged from a fundamental market shift that disrupted design's future while simultaneously presenting our greatest growth opportunity. ChatGPT had risen from just 1% to 5% as users' preferred starting point for searches in less than a year. <strong>This seismic shift meant that the very nature of how people approached creative work was changing, and Canva needed to evolve.</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>The urgency of this project became clear when we analyzed our existing CanvaGPT plugin performance. While it accounted for an impressive chunk of Canva AI usage with 17 million total uses, we were capturing less than 1% of ChatGPT's massive user base. The most striking finding was the <mark>very little user overlap between platforms</mark>, indicating that we were essentially serving two completely different user populations. This presented a massive untapped growth opportunity of millions of potential new users.</p>
                        
                        <p>Working as the Design Lead for the Integration Platform & Products team within the Ecosystem team at Canva, I collaborated with Product Lead, Engineering Lead, and a core team including Research Lead, Data Analyst, TPM, and Marketing manager. Beyond this core team, the project required coordination across <mark>many engineers spanning eight different teams</mark>: Ecosystem, GenAI, Editing Platform and Growth. The timeline was aggressive: we had a 6-month window to achieve feature parity with Canva AI across external AI assistant platforms, with our major launch milestone serving as the critical deliverable.</p>

                        <h3>The Core Problem</h3>
                        <p>Our existing CanvaGPT integration, while successful in driving a significant part of our CanvaAI usage, was failing to meet user expectations for AI-assisted design. Through user feedback analysis and behavioral data, I identified four critical user experience gaps:</p>

                                <li><strong>Conversational Expectation Gap</strong>: Users expected back-and-forth iteration like traditional LLMs, but CanvaGPT only provided one-off design outputs</li>
                                <li><strong>Context Switching Friction</strong>: Users had to manually discover and install CanvaGPT, breaking their natural workflow</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Seamless Context-Aware Transitions: Preserve user intent, workflow state, and creative context between platforms.</li>
                            <li>Optimize for Speed to Value: Users tolerate imperfection if they get an 80% complete design quickly.</li>
                            <li>Build a Scalable Design System: Create modular patterns adaptable to different AI interfaces.</li>
                            <li>Progressive Disclosure: Start with core features and reveal advanced options contextually.</li>
                            <li>Meet Core Needs and Align to User Intent: Focus on validated use cases rather than speculative features.</li>
                            <li>Achieve Parity with Canva AI: Users shouldn't experience feature degradation when starting from AI assistants.</li>
                            <li>Show the Value of Canva: Strategically expose Pro features to free users.</li>
                            <li>Build Lasting Relationships: Design features that improve with repeated use.</li>

                        <p><strong>What does the vision experience look like in ChatGPT?</strong></p>
                        <p>Through collaborative design sessions, I developed a vision for seamless AI-integrated design creation:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Natural AI conversation</strong> ‚Üí Design intent emerges organically</li>

                            <li><strong>Conversational design iteration</strong> ‚Üí Multiple rounds of AI-assisted refinement</li>
                            <li><strong>Intelligent handoff</strong> ‚Üí Smooth transition to Canva with full context preservation</li>
                            <li><strong>Continuous improvement loop</strong> ‚Üí Learning from user behavior to enhance AI assistance</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>Defining the AI-Human Handoff Framework</h3>
                        <p>One of the most critical design challenges was determining optimal handoff points between AI assistance and human control. I developed a framework based on three key factors:</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>1. Design Complexity Threshold</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>AI-optimal</strong>: Template selection, basic text/image placement, format conversion</li>
                            <li><strong>Human-optimal</strong>: Advanced typography, custom illustrations, complex layouts</li>
                            <li><strong>Hybrid</strong>: Brand application, tone adjustments, content localization</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>2. User Control Preferences</strong><br>Through user research, I mapped user comfort levels with AI automation:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>High comfort</strong>: Resizing, basic brand application, format conversion</li>
                            <li><strong>Medium comfort</strong>: Content tone changes, image selection, layout suggestions</li>
                            <li><strong>Low comfort</strong>: Final design decisions, complex brand interpretations, publication</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                        <p>Research showed social media managers maintain 5-7 platforms, each requiring different formats. My solution transformed this hours-long process into a natural conversation: "Create an Instagram post for my coffee shop's summer sale" followed by "Now I need this for Stories and LinkedIn too."</p>
                        
                        <p>This wasn't simple cropping; our intelligent resizing technology ensured intelligent recomposition maintaining visual hierarchy across different aspect ratios. I developed a framework for visual hierarchy preservation considering text legibility, image focal points, and brand element prominence.</p>
                        
                        <p>My batch preview system solved the challenge of presenting multiple format variations within ChatGPT's text-heavy interface using a compact grid view with highlighted differences.</p>

                        <p>SMB owners were spending 30% of design time manually applying brand elements. My solution created an intelligent brand detection system that analyzed conversation context to understand requirements.</p>
                        
                        <p>The system would first check for existing Canva brand kits and intelligently apply elements based on context and intent. For new users, I designed a streamlined creation flow within the AI conversation, generating a basic kit with complementary fonts, color palette, and placeholder logo space.</p>
                        
                        <p>I designed a before-and-after comparison interface showing generic designs alongside branded versions, with key elements highlighted. Users could adjust "brand intensity" through natural language.</p>

                        <p>I leveraged AI's natural language understanding to enable conversational design adaptation. When users requested "make this presentation more playful," the system orchestrated multiple changes: switching to rounded fonts, warming colors, adding illustrated elements, and rewriting copy.</p>
                        
                        <p>I developed a framework mapping specific transformation patterns: professional to casual transitions involved simplifying language and warming colors; technical to general added visual metaphors; formal to playful introduced dynamic typography.</p>
                        
                        <p>Localization capabilities considered cultural color associations, reading patterns, space requirements for different languages, and locally relevant imagery.</p>
