In this role, I look at it as the backbone of their toolchain, and I seek ways to help them use integrations and data connections to collaborate better, and ship value quicker.</p>
                        <p>In this project, I had the opportunity to design for developers to increase the visibility of work and reduce context switching. There are 3 designed experiences that were shipped:</p>

                        <p>I think of developer experiences as a core part of a developer's life. I believe that they should have at-par experiences at their place of work as they do in their personal life. Enterprise tools should consider their experiences outside of work, like making a booking with Airbnb, and emulate a similar feeling of delight and satisfaction. The tools should make them feel empowered, effective and collaborative. Ideally, to help developers switch off from work and reduce stress.</p>

                                <p>I've been leading design for DevOps experiences in Atlassian Agile and DevOps team since January 2022. I've been collaborating closely with researchers to come up with and execute a research plan for exploratory and usability research at the beginning and end of the project.</p>
        <p>At a strategic level, I've been working closely with the PM and data scientists to scope problems and potential areas for lighting up experiences. I'm deeply involved in the design which includes defining aspects like what data to show and how to show it.</p>
        <p>From an execution perspective, I've been planning and prioritizing deliverables. I've created end-to-end UI specs with inputs from UX writers, handed them off to engineers and ensured the fit and finish of the developed bits.</p>
                        <p>DevOps experiences for developers is an ongoing effort running in tight collaboration with members from multiple product teams and multiple disciplines: engineers, product managers, UX writers, designers, UX researchers and data scientists.</p>

                        <h3>Understanding DevOps and team processes</h3>
                        <p>Across the industry, development (dev) and operations (ops) teams are working closer than ever before to build and run software together. However, their toolchains are fragmented causing a lack of visibility & control. This is happening as businesses seek greater agility and velocity in order to address ever-increasing customer demands and competitive threats.</p>
                        <p>Our customers across all industries are looking for solutions that help them to consistently ship higher quality software, faster. For many teams, DevOps practices have become a valuable approach to achieving this outcome.</p>
                        <div class="highlight-box">
                            <p><strong>DevOps is a culture, a movement, a philosophy.</strong> The concept of DevOps is founded on building a culture of collaboration between teams that historically functioned in relative silos. DevOps is a set of practices that helps automate the processes between software development and IT teams in order that they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.</p>

                        <p>Atlassian offers tools out-of-the-box, for the whole team, like Jira Software, Bitbucket, OpsGenie and confluence. They also allow third-party tools like Github, Gitlab, ServiceNow, Slack, AWS, Jenkins etc. to plug and play into the products.</p>

                        <p>Developers and dev teams have processes for code development, testing, peer reviews and deploying software to their customers. As Jira is a task management board, they can see how the work is progressing but can sometimes miss what's happening on the codebase. The code pull request may be in review but the team members cannot grok that from the board and its columns unless they check the issues manually.</p>

                                Participants find a lot of value from being able to see which pull requests have been merged, and what issues have been deployed. Their current process for doing that takes many steps, across multiple products, but having a single location would streamline that process.

                        <p>In the quest for enabling users to be more productive, it's important to stay on the lookout for not creating dark patterns in the process that could burn out users. The amount of information, warnings & intensity is something that I've been conscious about.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Leverage user context to light up relevant warnings. Highlight relevant information to provide visibility to users.</li>
                            <li>Don't get in the way: Ensure efficient dismissal of the experiences. Respect user choices for not wanting their data being shown.</li>
                            <li>Continuously learn and adapt from user interactions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>What's important for one user may not be important for another user. It's necessary that <em>the system learns and adapts</em> to cater to different users better. We've used a mix of signals to identify whether the hover cards are relevant to the users or not.</p>
