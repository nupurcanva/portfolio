                        <h2>üëã About Me</h2>
                        <p>I'm a product designer who loves digging into messy, complex systems and finding clarity.</p>
                        <p>Whether it's shaping the app ecosystem at Canva, streamlining DevOps flows at Atlassian, or working on platform design at Microsoft, I design experiences that feel thoughtful, useful, and grounded in the real world.</p>
                        
                        <div class="highlight-box">
                            <p><strong>üéØ I focus most on vision-level work:</strong> where we're going, why it matters, and how the small details ladder up to a bigger story.</p>

                        <h2>üåê I design for ecosystems, not just features</h2>
                        <p>At Canva, I work on experiences that connect third-party apps, integrations, and internal tooling.</p>
                        <p>It's a lot of invisible UX, but that's what I enjoy‚Äîdesigning systems that work well for both builders and users.</p>
                        
                        <h3>What I keep in mind:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Who are all the players, and how do they connect?</li>
                            <li>How can I make things extensible but still feel native?</li>
                            <li>What patterns will scale across the platform?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <div class="highlight-box">
                            <p><strong>üéÆ Core focus:</strong> I'm especially interested in designing the "rules of the game"‚Äîthe structures that help other builders thrive.</p>

                    </div>

                    <!-- Questions -->
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h2>I ask a lot of questions (the good kind)</h2>
                        <p>My design process isn't about jumping into Figma. It starts with getting aligned‚Äîon the problem, the people, and what success even looks like.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How I bring structure to ambiguity:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vision workshops and mapping sessions</li>
                            <li>Synthesising research into design principles</li>
                            <li>Communicating trade-offs, not just solutions</li>
                        </ul>

                    <!-- Mobile -->
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h2>I care about mobile beyond "does it resize?"</h2>
                        <p>Mobile UX is more than making it fit‚Äîit's about intent, attention, and touch.</p>
                        <p>I've worked on mobile-first experiences at Canva, especially around app discovery and usage.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Things I keep top of mind:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Can someone understand this in 3 seconds?</li>
                            <li>Is it obvious what to do next?</li>
                            <li>How does this feel in someone's hand?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <div class="highlight-box">
                            <p><strong>I believe mobile-first thinking makes every experience sharper‚Äîeven on desktop.</strong></p>

                        <h2>üß† I flex between strategy and detail</h2>
                        <p>Some days I'm sketching service blueprints, other days I'm deep in microcopy or prototyping edge cases.</p>
                        <p>I move between zoomed-out thinking and zoomed-in craft, depending on what the team needs.</p>
                        
                        <h3>I've worked on:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Early vision work (like Bitbucket Pipelines)</li>
                            <li>Pattern design for scale (like Smart DevOps setup flows)</li>
                            <li>Cross-functional problem solving across PMs and engineers</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p><strong>üå≤ Sweet spot:</strong> I'm happiest when I'm helping teams see the forest and the trees.</p>

                        <h2>I like sharing the why, not just the what</h2>
                        <p>A polished screen is great‚Äîbut I care more about showing how I got there.</p>
                        <p>I try to make my thinking transparent so it's easier to collaborate and build trust.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How I do this:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I annotate flows, not just present them</li>
                            <li>I use 1-pagers to bring folks into the process</li>
                            <li>I write to reflect, not just to document</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <div class="highlight-box">
                            <p><strong>I'm a big believer that clarity and storytelling are core design skills‚Äînot just nice add-ons.</strong></p>

                        <h2>I believe in good vibes and clear comms</h2>
                        <p>UX is collaborative. I work closely with triads, engineers, and other designers‚Äîand I'm big on giving credit, asking thoughtful questions, and keeping momentum without burning people out.</p>
                        
                        <h3>What collaboration looks like for me:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Clarity > cleverness</li>
                            <li>Feedback early and often</li>
                            <li>Helping unblock others when I can</li>
                            <li>Keeping conversations human, even in complex spaces</li>
