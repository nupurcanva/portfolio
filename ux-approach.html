                        <p>I'm a product designer who loves digging into messy, complex systems and finding clarity. Whether it's shaping ecosystems, streamlining workflows, or building platforms, I design experiences that feel thoughtful, useful, and grounded in the real world.</p>

                        <p>At Canva, I work on experiences that connect third-party apps, integrations, and internal tooling.</p>
                        <p>It's a lot of invisible UX, but that's what I enjoy: designing systems that work well for both builders and users.</p>

                            <li>Who are all the players, and how do they connect?</li>
                            <li>How can I make things extensible but still feel native?</li>
                            <li>What patterns will scale across the platform?</li>
                            <li>How do we balance strategic vision with immediate user needs?</li>

                    <!-- Questions -->
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h2>I ask a lot of questions (the strategic kind)</h2>
                        <p>My design process isn't about jumping into Figma. It starts with getting aligned: on the problem, the people, and what success even looks like. I've learned that creating space for shared framing before moving to solutions prevents revision cycles and builds stronger stakeholder partnerships.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How I bring structure to ambiguity:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vision workshops and mapping sessions - I facilitate alignment before execution</li>
                            <li>Synthesizing research into design principles - Turning insights into actionable frameworks</li>
                            <li>Communicating trade-offs, not just solutions - Making assumptions and constraints explicit</li>
                            <li>Clarifying ownership and expectations upfront - "Are you looking for me to shape direction here, or execute something you've already got in mind?"</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>I present work-in-progress with explicit context about assumptions and invite shaping rather than judgment. This approach has strengthened my strategic partnerships and reduced the need for major revisions.</p>

                        <p>Some days I'm sketching journeys and leading enterprise roundtables, other days I'm deep in microcopy or prototyping edge cases. I move between zoomed-out thinking and zoomed-in craft, depending on what the team needs.</p>

                        <h2>üß† I leverage AI strategically in my workflow</h2>
                        <p>AI is deeply embedded in my day-to-day work, but not as a replacement for design thinking; as an amplifier for productivity and insight generation.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How I use AI to enhance design:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Rapid prototyping and iteration</strong> - Creating coded prototypes and testing concepts faster</li>
                            <li><strong>Research synthesis at scale</strong> - Analyzing large volumes of user feedback to surface patterns</li>
                            <li><strong>Strategic analysis support</strong> - Mapping user journeys and identifying friction points</li>
                            <li><strong>Making technical concepts accessible</strong> - Translating complex integration patterns for broader teams</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>This approach has transformed how I work: faster validation cycles, data-driven decisions, and more strategic time allocation for high-value design thinking.</p>

                        <p>A polished screen is great, but I care more about showing how I got there.</p>
                        <p>I try to make my thinking transparent so it's easier to collaborate and build trust.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How I do this:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I annotate flows, not just present them - Context and rationale travel with the work</li>
                            <li>I use 1-pagers to bring folks into the process - Structured thinking documents that align teams</li>
                            <li>I write to reflect, not just to document - Capturing assumptions and learnings for future work</li>
                            <li>I present work-in-progress with explicit context - Inviting the right kind of feedback at the right time</li>

                            <p><strong>I'm a big believer that clarity and storytelling are core design skills, not just nice add-ons. They enable better collaboration and stronger strategic influence.</strong></p>

                        <h3>What collaboration looks like for me:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Clarity > cleverness - Simple, direct communication that moves work forward</li>
                            <li>Feedback early and often - Creating space for input before decisions are locked</li>
                            <li>Helping unblock others when I can - Proactive problem-solving and knowledge sharing</li>
                            <li>Keeping conversations human, even in complex spaces - Building relationships alongside delivering work</li>
                            <li>Coaching design outcomes - Helping team members grow their craft and confidence</li>
                            <li>Championing team wins - Recognizing contributions and fostering cross-functional energy</li>

                        <p>I've spent 8 years designing for technical audiences - from Azure DevOps engineers to Canva API developers. I understand REST APIs, OAuth flows, webhooks, and CI/CD pipelines not just conceptually, but practically.

                            <li><strong>Realistic constraints</strong> - My designs account for actual technical limitations, not theoretical ones</li>
                            <li><strong>Better partnerships</strong> - Engineers trust designers who speak their language and understand their challenges</li>
                            <li><strong>Platform thinking</strong> - I design systems that scale because I understand how they'll be implemented</li>
