                            <h3>Reimagining Enterprise Collaboration Tools</h3>
                            <p>When a major enterprise collaboration platform needed a complete redesign, I led the end-to-end user experience transformation. The existing integration suffered from poor notification systems, confusing onboarding flows, and inconsistent UI patterns that frustrated users. I owned the full redesign across two major milestones, creating high-fidelity specifications that achieved feature parity with competitor platforms while introducing research-driven improvements.</p>
                            
                            <p>Through design sparring sessions and close collaboration with system integrators, I ensured technical feasibility while maintaining user-centered design principles. The result was a robust integration that significantly improved collaboration and notification experiences, leading to increased adoption among enterprise customers.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Designing AI-Powered Creative Workflows</h3>
                            <p>I spearheaded the design of comprehensive user journeys for AI assistant integrations, focusing on seamless creative workflows. The challenge was making our platform the default choice for AI-assisted design work, supporting everything from content creation to brand application within conversational interfaces.</p>
                            
                            <p>I created clickable prototypes for critical use cases including tone adaptation, media uploads, and automated resizing capabilities. By designing and testing interfaces that simulated familiar AI chat experiences, I ensured users could intuitively access advanced design features without leaving their preferred AI assistant. This work directly contributed to achieving a major company goal and positioned our platform as the go-to solution for AI-powered design.</p>

                            <h3>Transforming Developer Experience Through AI</h3>
                            <p>I co-led the strategic design of a revolutionary prompt-based interface that democratized app creation on our developer platform. Recognizing that traditional development barriers were limiting our ecosystem growth, I helped conceptualize and design an AI-powered playground where both technical and non-technical users could build and preview applications using natural language.</p>
                            
                            <p>Through organizing hackathons and creating proof-of-concept demos, I demonstrated the viability of this approach. The strategy included comprehensive enablement programs, tutorial creation, and workflow documentation that lowered barriers to entry. This initiative fostered a culture of experimentation and significantly expanded our developer community.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Building Strategic Frameworks for Platform Integrations</h3>
                            <p>When tasked with systematizing how our platform integrates with third-party services, I developed comprehensive frameworks and guidelines that became the foundation for all future integration work. I authored strategic documentation that aligned cross-functional teams around unified approaches to API design, user authentication flows, and data exchange protocols.</p>
                            
                            <p>By creating reusable patterns and best practices, I enabled faster development cycles and more consistent user experiences across all integrations. This strategic work influenced how product, engineering, and research teams approach new partnership opportunities.</p>

                            <p>I co-led extensive research sessions with 16+ strategic enterprise customers across the Asia-Pacific region to validate AI workflow concepts and platform capabilities. Through carefully structured roundtables and in-depth interviews, I uncovered critical insights about governance requirements, workflow integration needs, and administrative controls.</p>
                            
                            <p>I synthesized complex findings into actionable recommendations that directly shaped our platform strategy and roadmap. The research revealed previously unknown pain points around security and monitoring, leading to new feature prioritization that better served enterprise needs.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Conducting Cross-Platform Integration Studies</h3>
                            <p>For a critical email marketing platform integration, I led comprehensive user research that included co-design sessions with the partner's team and diary studies with end users. The research uncovered significant challenges around version control, cross-platform analytics, and return flow navigation.</p>
                            
                            <p>Through iterative testing and continuous user feedback, I identified solutions that balanced technical constraints with user expectations. The insights led to design decisions that enabled seamless workflows between platforms, resulting in higher user satisfaction and increased feature adoption.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Developing Data-Driven Personas</h3>
                            <p>I spearheaded a comprehensive research initiative to update our developer personas, conducting in-depth interviews with diverse user segments. Moving beyond surface-level demographics, I explored motivations, technical capabilities, and workflow preferences to create nuanced archetypes.</p>
                            
                            <p>The research culminated in launching a dedicated website resource and validation panels with the community. These personas now guide product decisions across the organization and have been shared company-wide to ensure all teams understand our diverse developer ecosystem.</p>
