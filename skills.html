                            <p>When Microsoft Teams users needed to create visual content, they faced a fragmented experience that required constant context-switching between applications. I led the complete redesign of how Canva integrates within Microsoft Teams, taking ownership of the entire user journey from discovery to daily use.</p>
                            
                            <p>I crafted an intuitive experience that allows users to create, edit, and share designs without leaving their Teams environment. This included designing smart notification systems that keep team members informed without overwhelming them, creating contextual onboarding that appears exactly when users need guidance, and developing error states that actually help users resolve issues rather than leaving them stuck. The visual language I developed maintains consistency with both platforms while feeling native to each. The result was a 40% reduction in support tickets and adoption by major enterprises including Deloitte.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Democratizing App Development Through Conversational Design</h3>
                            <p>Traditional app development requires coding knowledge, creating a barrier for creative professionals who have great ideas but lack technical skills. I co-led the design of an innovative platform that allows anyone to build functional applications using natural language.</p>
                            
                            <p>Instead of writing code, users simply describe what they want to create, and the system generates a working prototype. I designed the conversational interface to guide users through the development process, providing intelligent suggestions and catching potential issues before they become problems. The system I designed can understand intent from simple descriptions like "I need an app that helps users choose color palettes" and transform that into a functional tool. This breakthrough interface reduced app creation time from days to minutes and opened development to an entirely new audience of creators.</p>

                            <h3>Positioning Design as the Native Language of AI Assistants</h3>
                            <p>As AI assistants like ChatGPT and Claude became mainstream, a critical opportunity emerged: making visual design as natural in AI conversations as text. I led the strategic initiative to establish Canva as the default design platform across all major AI assistants.</p>
                            
                            <p>This meant architecting a comprehensive framework for how AI assistants would understand and execute design tasks. I defined patterns for everything from simple requests ("make this more professional") to complex workflows ("create a brand-consistent social media campaign for product launch"). My strategy included designing for different user contexts—from free users discovering capabilities to enterprise teams needing branded outputs at scale.</p>
                            
                            <p>I created systematic documentation that became the playbook for all AI integrations, ensuring consistency while allowing for each assistant's unique capabilities. This strategic foundation positioned Canva to capture the emerging market of AI-driven design, with early metrics showing 3x higher engagement when design tasks are available natively in AI conversations.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Reimagining Developer Engagement Through Human-Centered Personas</h3>
                            <p>The developer ecosystem is often approached through a technical lens, missing the human motivations that drive platform adoption. I transformed our understanding of developers by leading comprehensive research that revealed distinct personas with unique needs, motivations, and barriers.</p>
                            
                            <p>Through in-depth interviews and behavioral analysis, I identified key archetypes: the Entrepreneur building their first SaaS product, the Creative Developer bridging design and code, the Enterprise Architect ensuring scalability, and the Hobbyist exploring possibilities. Each persona came with specific journey maps, pain points, and success metrics.</p>
                            
                            <p>I translated these insights into a living resource that product teams now use to validate every feature decision. This strategic shift from feature-first to persona-first development has resulted in more intuitive APIs, better documentation, and a 45% reduction in developer onboarding time.</p>

                            <h3>Validating Enterprise Workflows Through Strategic Customer Research</h3>
                            <p>I co-led comprehensive research sessions with 16+ strategic enterprise customers across the APJ region to understand how large organizations actually use design tools within their workflows. Working alongside my research partner, I engaged directly with enterprise teams to validate AI workflow concepts and uncover governance requirements.</p>
                            
                            <p>Through structured roundtables and in-depth interviews, I gathered feedback on AI assistant use cases, workflow integration needs, and governance challenges. I created Figma screens and presentation decks to facilitate these discussions, ensuring we captured both technical requirements and human needs. Additionally, I conducted targeted research with customer teams for the MS Teams integration, developing research plans and discussion guides to understand their specific collaboration patterns.</p>
                            
                            <p>I synthesized all findings into actionable insights that directly influenced platform strategy and the 2025 roadmap for security, sandboxing, and monitoring capabilities. This research formed the foundation for our enterprise platform positioning and RICE infrastructure planning.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Understanding AI-Assisted Creativity Through Diary Studies</h3>
                            <p>I worked on diary studies to understand how users interact with AI-powered design tools over time. I created high-fidelity, clickable prototypes that simulated ChatGPT-like interfaces, focusing on key workflows including resizing, brand kit application, and editing capabilities.</p>
                            
                            <p>Working with team mates, I ran structured studies where users documented their experiences using AI assistants for design tasks. Through careful observation and synthesis, I identified patterns in how users wanted to interact with AI for design tasks like tone adaptation, brand guidelines application, and media uploads.</p>
                            
                            <p>These insights directly shaped the frameworks I created for systematizing AI assistant integrations. My research findings influenced the design of all major user journeys and flows for AI assistant integrations, ensuring that Canva's approach to AI-assisted design was grounded in real user behaviors and needs.</p>
